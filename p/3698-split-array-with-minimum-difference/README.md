# [Split Array With Minimum Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-with-minimum-difference/)

## Question Description
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

Split the array into two non-empty parts such that:
- The left part contains the first i + 1 elements
- The right part contains the remaining n - i - 1 elements

The difference between the two parts is the absolute difference between the sum of the left part and the sum of the right part.

Return the minimum difference possible between the two parts.

## Constraints
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

---

## Approach
- Precompute prefix sums (left sums) and track if the left part is strictly increasing
- Precompute suffix sums (right sums) and track if the right part is strictly decreasing
- For each possible split index i:
  - If left[0..i] is strictly increasing and right[i+1..n-1] is strictly decreasing,
    calculate the difference = |leftSum - rightSum|
  - Keep track of the minimum difference found
- If no valid split exists, return -1

**Why this approach works:**
- Precomputing prefix and suffix sums allows O(1) lookup for any split point
- The strictly increasing/decreasing conditions ensure valid splits
- Single pass through array for both prefix and suffix computations
- Final pass finds minimum valid difference

**Alternative approaches considered:**
- Could compute sums for each split point individually, but would be O(n^2) time
- Could use two pointers, but prefix/suffix approach is more efficient

## Dry Run
Example Input: `nums = [2, 3, 1]`

Step-by-step execution:
- Step 1: Compute prefix sums and increasing check:
  - leftSum = [2, 5, 6]
  - leftValid = [true, true, false] (3 > 1 fails at i=2)
- Step 2: Compute suffix sums and decreasing check:
  - rightSum = [6, 4, 1]
  - rightValid = [false, true, true]
- Step 3: Evaluate splits:
  - i = 0: leftValid[0] && rightValid[1] = true && true, diff = |2 - 4| = 2
  - i = 1: leftValid[1] && rightValid[2] = true && true, diff = |5 - 1| = 4
- Step 4: Minimum difference = 2

Final Answer = `2`

Example Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

Step-by-step execution:
- Step 1: All prefix parts are strictly increasing ✓
- Step 2: All suffix parts are strictly decreasing ✓
- Step 3: Check all split points:
  - i = 0: diff = |1 - (10)| = 9
  - i = 1: diff = |3 - (7)| = 4
  - i = 2: diff = |6 - (4)| = 2
- Step 4: Minimum difference = 2

Final Answer = `2`

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public long splitArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // prefix sums + strictly increasing check
        boolean[] left = new boolean[n];
        long[] leftSum = new long[n];
        left[0] = true;
        leftSum[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = left[i - 1] && nums[i - 1] < nums[i];
            leftSum[i] = leftSum[i - 1] + nums[i];
        }

        // suffix sums + strictly decreasing check
        boolean[] right = new boolean[n];
        long[] rightSum = new long[n];
        right[n - 1] = true;
        rightSum[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            right[i] = right[i + 1] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1];
            rightSum[i] = rightSum[i + 1] + nums[i];
        }

        // evaluate all splits
        long min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        boolean found = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (left[i] && right[i + 1]) {
                min = Math.min(min, Math.abs(leftSum[i] - rightSum[i + 1]));
                found = true;
            }
        }

        return found ? min : -1;
    }
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - one pass for prefix sums and checks, one pass for suffix sums and checks, one pass for evaluating splits
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - arrays leftSum, rightSum, leftValid, rightValid each take O(n)
